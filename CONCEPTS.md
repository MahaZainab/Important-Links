|3 |Diagram, 1. Add a diagram of methodology by just drawing blocks, like Figue 1 of this paper here. The flow can be: 1. QA pair and relevant examples by Tf-IDF as CoT --> 2. LLM prompt to generate answer  (Refer to the prompt in appendix. We need to give system prompt for both CodeQA and CS1QA) ---> 3. LLM as Judge to assess answer

2. A small example of an image like Figure 3 or 5 of the paper would be good. The image in our case could align to our methodology: 1. QA pair and relevant examples by Tf-IDF as CoT  --> 2. LLM prompt to generate answer   â€”->3.  LLM as Judge output and scores.

## Multi-agent Debate(Debate):
Typically MAD consist of three steps:
1. response generation: Each agent produces its initial solution based upon its unique perspective
Debate: Agents debate to indentify logical inconsistencies or knowledge gap
3. Consensus Building: where consensus is determined by
